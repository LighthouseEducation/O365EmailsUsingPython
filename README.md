# O365EmailsUsingPython
Small script to send emails from a csv file using python3. 

Test file includes an example for sending to multiple email address, attaching pdf documents, and using inline images.

File has a ridiculous amount of comments so I could remember how to do it all later. Hopefully somebody else will find it helpful.
